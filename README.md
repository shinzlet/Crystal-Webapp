# Crystal Webapp
This is just a little project I'm toying with to learn some fundamental backend stuff. Written in [crystal <3](https://crystal-lang.org)

## Installation
In theory, you've just gotta clone this bad boy, then cd in and run
```
crystal run src/server.cr
```

Then, pop open a browser and skedaddle over to http://localhost:8080

## Oh, oh, oh! Important aside I forgot
This is *horrendously insecure.* Never run it on a public network. I'm not *totally* sure, but I'm *pretty* sure that this would let anybody access any of your files on the computer you ran it on (nothing is sanitized).
Keep it on localhost.
